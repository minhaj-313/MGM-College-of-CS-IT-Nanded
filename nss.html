                <h1>National Service Scheme (NSS)</h1>
                <H2>History</H2>
                <p>After independence, the University Grants Commission, headed by S. Radhakrishnan, recommended the
                    introduction of voluntary national service in academic institutions. This idea was again considered
                    by the Central Advisory Board of Education (CABE) at its meeting in January, 1950; after examining
                    the idea and the experiences of other countries in this field, the board recommended that students
                    and teachers should devote time to voluntary manual work. In the draft first Five-Year Plan adopted
                    by the government in 1952, the need for social and labour service by Indian students for one year
                    was stressed. In 1958, Jawaharlal Nehru, in a letter to the chief ministers, considered the idea of
                    social service as a prerequisite for graduation. He directed the Ministry of Education to formulate
                    a suitable scheme for the introduction of national service into academic institutions. </p>
                <br>
                <H2>Launch of NSS</H2>
                <p>In May 1969, a conference of student representatives (of universities and institutions of higher
                    education) convened by the Ministry of Education and the University Grants Commission also
                    unanimously agreed that a national-service scheme could be an instrument for national integration.
                    The details were soon worked out and orientation camp was organized at Rajghat. This camp was
                    concluded on 7 June 1969. KKGupta from University of Delhi was declared first volunteer. The
                    Planning Commission sanctioned an outlay of ₹5 crores for the NSS during the Fourth Five-Year Plan,
                    stipulating that the NSS be a pilot project in selected institutions and universities. On 24
                    September 1969, the then Union Education Minister V.K.R.V. Rao launched the NSS at 37 universities
                    across all states. The scheme has been extended to all states and universities in the country, and
                    also 10+2 level institutes in many states. </p>
                <br>
                <H2>Organization</H2>
                <p>At national level, Ministry of Youth Affairs & Sports, Delhi, Government of India, is the nodal
                    authority, which works with state-level NSS cells. State-level NSS cells are responsibility of the
                    respective state governments. Within states, each university has University level NSS cell under
                    which institutions (schools and colleges) based NSS units operate. Most government and
                    government-aided institutions have volunteer NSS units. Institutions are encouraged to have NSS
                    volunteers. A unit typically comprises 20–40 students. They are managed internally by a responsible
                    party from the school or college, who reports to the regional NSS coordinator. Most institutions do
                    not have a separate uniform for NSS volunteers as one of the great and dedicated towards the welfare
                    of India.</p>
                <br>
                <H2>Types of Activities</H2>
                <p>There are two types of activities: Regular Activities (120 hours) and Annual Special Camp (120
                    hours). All the NSS Volunteers who have served NSS for at least 2 years and have performed 240 hours
                    of work under NSS are entitled to a certificate from the university under the signature of the
                    Vice-Chancellor and the Programme Coordinator. The Annual camps are known as Special Camps. Camps
                    are held annually, funded by the government of India, and are usually located in a rural village or
                    a city suburb. Volunteers may be involved in such activities as:
                <ul>
                    <li>Cleaning</li>
                    <li>Afforestation</li>
                    <li>Stage shows or a procession creating awareness of such issues as social problems, education
                        and
                        cleanliness</li>
                    <li>Awareness Rallies</li>
                    <li>Inviting doctors for health camps </li>
                </ul>
                There are no pre-defined or pre-assigned tasks; it is left up to the volunteers to provide
                service in any way that is feasible. Camps typically last between a week and 10 days, although
                camps for shorter periods are also conducted by NSS.
